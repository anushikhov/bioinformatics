# Cells and Genomes  

## The universal features of cells on Earth  
## The diversity of genomes and the tree of life  
## Genetic information in eukaryotes  

The surface of our planet is populated by living things - curious, intricately organized chemical factories that take in matter from their surroundings and use these raw materials to generate copies of themselves.   

All living things are made of cells: small, membrane-enclosed units filled with a concentrated aqueous solution of chemicals and endowed with the extraordinary ability to create copies of themselves by growing and then dividing in two.   

**Cells are the fundamental units of life.**   

Cell biology is the study of the structure, function, and behavior of cells.  

_"The key to every biological problem must finally be sought in the cell; for every living organism is, or at some time has been, a cell."_   

The whole of biology is thus a counterpoint between two themes: astonishing variety in individual particulars; astonishing constancy in fundamental mechanisms.
