# Cells and Genomes  

* **The universal features of cells on Earth**  
* **The diversity of genomes and the tree of life**  
* **Genetic information in eukaryotes**  

The surface of our planet is populated by living things - curious, intricately organized chemical factories that take in matter from their surroundings and use these raw materials to generate copies of themselves.   

All living things are made of cells: small, membrane-enclosed units filled with a concentrated aqueous solution of chemicals and endowed with the extraordinary ability to create copies of themselves by growing and then dividing in two.   

**Cells are the fundamental units of life.**   

Cell biology is the study of the structure, function, and behavior of cells.  

_"The key to every biological problem must finally be sought in the cell; for every living organism is, or at some time has been, a cell."_   

The whole of biology is thus a counterpoint between two themes: astonishing variety in individual particulars; astonishing constancy in fundamental mechanisms.  


## The Universal Features of Cells on Earth  

The parent organism hands down information specifying, in extraordinary detail, the characteristics that the offspring shall have. This phenomenon of _heredity_ is central to the definition of life: it distinguishes life from other processes, such as the growth of a crystal. Living organism must consume free energy to create and maintain its organization. But life employs the free energy to drive a hugely complex system of chemical processes that are specified by hereditary information.  

Even for the aggregate of more than 10^13 cells that form a human body, **the whole organism has been generated by cell divisions from a single cell.**  

**The single cell, therefore, is the vehicle for all of the hereditary information that defines each species. This cell includes the machinery to gather raw materials from the environment and to construct from them a new cell in its own image, complete with a new copy of its hereditary information.**  


### All cells store their hereditary information in the same linear chemical code: DNA  

Living cells, like computers, store information. All living cells on Earth store their hereditary information in the form of double-standard molecules of DNA - long, unbranched, paired polymer chains, formed always of the same four types of monomers. These monomers, chemical compounds known as nucleotides, have nicknames drawn from a four-letter alphabet - A, T, C, G - and they are strung together in a long linear sequence that encodes the genetic information, just as the sequence of 1s and 0s encodes the information in a computer file. We can take a piece of DNA from a human cell and insert it into a bacterium, or a piece of bacterial DNA and insert it into a human cell, and the information will be successfully read, interpreted, and copied. Using chemical methods, scientists have learned how to read out the complete sequence of monomers in any DNA molecule - extending for many millions of nucleotides - and thereby decipher all of the hereditary information that each organism contains.

### All cells replicate their hereditary information by templated polymerization

The mechanisms that make life possible depend on the structure of the double-standard DNA molecule. Each monomer in a single DNA strand - that is, each nucleotide - consists of two parts: a sugar (deoxyribose) with a phosphate group attached to it, and a base, which may be either adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T).
