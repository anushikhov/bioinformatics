# Cells and Genomes  

* **The universal features of cells on Earth**  
* **The diversity of genomes and the tree of life**  
* **Genetic information in eukaryotes**  

The surface of our planet is populated by living things - curious, intricately organized chemical factories that take in matter from their surroundings and use these raw materials to generate copies of themselves.   

All living things are made of cells: small, membrane-enclosed units filled with a concentrated aqueous solution of chemicals and endowed with the extraordinary ability to create copies of themselves by growing and then dividing in two.   

**Cells are the fundamental units of life.**   

Cell biology is the study of the structure, function, and behavior of cells.  

_"The key to every biological problem must finally be sought in the cell; for every living organism is, or at some time has been, a cell."_   

The whole of biology is thus a counterpoint between two themes: astonishing variety in individual particulars; astonishing constancy in fundamental mechanisms.  


## The Universal Features of Cells on Earth  

The parent organism hands down information specifying, in extraordinary detail, the characteristics that the offspring shall have. This phenomenon of _heredity_ is central to the definition of life: it distinguishes life from other processes, such as the growth of a crystal. Living organism must consume free energy to create and maintain its organization. But life employs the free energy to drive a hugely complex system of chemical processes that are specified by hereditary information.  

Even for the aggregate of more than 10^13 cells that form a human body, **the whole organism has been generated by cell divisions from a single cell.**  

**The single cell, therefore, is the vehicle for all of the hereditary information that defines each species. This cell includes the machinery to gather raw materials from the environment and to construct from them a new cell in its own image, complete with a new copy of its hereditary information.**  


### All cells store their hereditary information in the same linear chemical code: DNA  

Living cells, like computers, store information. All living cells on Earth store their hereditary information in the form of double-stranded molecules of DNA - long, unbranched, paired polymer chains, formed always of the same four types of monomers. These monomers, chemical compounds known as nucleotides, have nicknames drawn from a four-letter alphabet - A, T, C, G - and they are strung together in a long linear sequence that encodes the genetic information, just as the sequence of 1s and 0s encodes the information in a computer file. We can take a piece of DNA from a human cell and insert it into a bacterium, or a piece of bacterial DNA and insert it into a human cell, and the information will be successfully read, interpreted, and copied. Using chemical methods, scientists have learned how to read out the complete sequence of monomers in any DNA molecule - extending for many millions of nucleotides - and thereby decipher all of the hereditary information that each organism contains.

### All cells replicate their hereditary information by templated polymerization

The mechanisms that make life possible depend on the structure of the double-stranded DNA molecule. Each monomer in a single DNA strand - that is, each nucleotide - consists of two parts: a sugar (deoxyribose) with a phosphate group attached to it, and a base, which may be either adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T). Each sugar is linked to the next via the phosphate group, creating a polymer chain composed of a repetitive sugar-phosphate backbone with a series of bases protruding from it. The DNA polymer is extended by adding monomers at one end. For a single isolated strand, these monomers can, in principle, be added in any order, because each one links to the next in the same way, through the part of the molecule that is the same for all of them. In the living cell, however, DNA is not synthesized as a free strand in isolation, but on a template formed by a preexisting DNA strand. The bases protruding from the existing strand bind to bases of the strand being syntesized, according to a strict rule defined by the complementary structures of the bases: A binds to T, and C binds to G. This base-pairing holds fresh monomers in place and thereby controls the selection of which one of the four monomers shall be added to the growing strand next. In this way, a double-stranded structure is created, consisting of two exactly complementary sequences of As, Cs, Ts, and Gs. The two strands twist around each other, forming a DNA double helix.

(A) DNA is made from simple subunits, called nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar-phosphate molecule with a nitrogen-containing side group, or base, attached to it. The bases are of four types (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine), corresponding to four distinct nucleoides, labeled A, G, C, and T.  

(B) A single strand of DNA consists of nucleotides joined together by sugar-phosphate linkages. The individual sugar-phosphate units are asymmetric, giving the backbone of the strand a definite directionality, or polarity. This directionality guides the molecular processes by which the information in DNA is interpreted and copied in cells: the information is always "read" in a consistent order, just as written English text is read from left to right.  

(C) Through templated polymerization, the sequence of nucleotides in an existing DNA strand controls the sequence in which nucleotides are joined together in a new DNA strand; T in one strand pairs with A in the other, and G in one strand with C in the other. The new strand has a nucleotide sequence complementary to that of the old strand, and a backbone with opposite directionality: corresponding to the GTAA... of the original strand, it has ...TTAC.  

(D) A normal DNA molecule consists of two such complementary strands. The nucleotides within each strand are linked by strong (covalent) chemical bonds/ the complementary nucletides on opposite strands are held together more weakly, by hydrogen bonds.  

(E) The two strands twist around each other to form a double helix - a robust structure that can accommodate any sequence of nucleotides without altering its basic structure.  

The bonds between the base pairs are weak compared with the sugar-phosphate links, and this allows the two DNA strands to be pulled apart without breakage of their backbones. Each strand then can serve as a template for the synthesis of a fresh DNA strand complementary to itself - a fresh copy, that is, of the hereditary information.   

![The copying of genetic information by DNA replication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anushikhov/molecular-biology/master/img/1-3.png)  

The two strands of a DNA double helix are pulled apart, and each serves as a template for synthesis of a new complementary strand.  

In different types of cells, this process of _DNA replication_ occurs at different rates, with different controls to start it or stop it, and different auxiliary molecules to help it along. But the basics are universal: **DNA is the information store for heredity, and templated polymerization is the way in which this information is copied throughtout the living world.**

### All cells transcribe portions of their hereditary information into the same intermediary form: RNA  

To carry out its information-bearing function, DNA must do more than copy itself. It must also express its information, by letting the information guide the synthesis of other molecules in the cell. This expression occurs by a mechanism that is the same in all living organisms, leading first and foremost to the production of two other key classes of polymers: RNAs and proteins. The process begins with a templated polymerization called _transcription_, in which segments of the DNA sequence are used as templates for the synthesis of shorter molecules of the closely related polymer ribonucleic acid, or RNA. Later, in the more complex process of translation, many of these RNA molecules direct the synthesis of polymers of a radically different chemical class - the proteins.

Genetic information is read out and put to use through a two-step process. First, in transcription, segments of the DNA sequence are used to guide the synthesis of molecules of RNA. Then, in translation, the RNA molecules are used to guide the synthesis of molecules of protein.

In RNA, the backbone is formed of a slightly different sugar from that of DNA - ribose instead of deoxyribose - and one of the four bases is slightly different - uracil (U) in place of thymine (T). But the other three bases - A, C, and G - are the same, and all four bases pair with their complementary counterparts in DNA - the A, U, C, and G of RNA with the T, A, G, and C of DNA. During transciption, the RNA monomers are lined up and selected for polymerization on a template strand of DNA, just as DNA monomers are selected during replication. The outcome is a polymer molecule whose sequence of nucleotides faithfully represents a portion of the cell's genetic information, even though it is written in a slightly different alphabet - consisting of RNA monomers instead of DNA monomers.  

The same segment of DNA can be used repeatedly to guide the synthesis of many identical RNA molecules. Thus, whereas the cell's archive of genetic information in the form of DNA is fixed and sacrosanct, these RNA transcripts are mass-produced and disposable. These transcripts function as intermediates in the transfer of genetic information. Most notably, they serve as _messenger RNA (mRNA)_ molecules that guide the synthesis of proteins according to the genetic instructions stored in the DNA.  

![How genetic information is broadcast for use inside the cell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anushikhov/molecular-biology/master/img/1-5.png)  

Each cell contains a fixed set of DNA molecules - its archive of genetic information. A given segment of this DNA guides the synthesis of many identical RNA transcripts, which serve as working copies of the information stored in the archive. Many different sets of RNA molecules can be made by transcribing different parts of a cell's DNA sequences, allowing different types of cells to use the same information store differently.  

RNA molecules have distinctive structures that can also give them other specialized chemical capabilities. Being single-stranded, their backbone is flexible, so that the polymer chain can bend back on itself to allow one part of the molecule to form weak bonds with another part of the same molecule. This occurs when segments of the sequence are locally complementary: a ...GGGG... segment, for example, will tend to associate with a ...CCCC... segment. These types of internal associations can cause an RNA chain to fold up into a specific shape that is dictated by its sequence. The shape of the RNA molecule, in turn, may enable it to recognize other molecules by binding to them selectively - and even, in certain cases, to catalyze chemical changes in the molecules that are bound.

### All cells use proteins as catalysts  

Protein molecules, like DNA and RNA molecules, are long unbranched polymer chains, formed by stringing together monomeric building blocks drawn from a standard repertoire that is the same for all living cells. Porteins also carry information in the form of a linear sequence of symbols. There are many different protein molecules in each cell, and - leaving out the water - they form most of the cell's mass.   

The monomers of protein, the amino acids, are quite different from those of DNA and RNA, and there are 20 types instead of 4. Each amino acid is built around the same core structure through which it can be linked in a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character. Each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface, these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds. In this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell.

![How a protein molecule acts as a catalyst for a chemical reaction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anushikhov/molecular-biology/master/img/1-7.png)  

Proteins have many other functions as well - maintaining structures, generating movements, sensing signals, and so on - each protein molecule performing a specific function according to its own genetically specified sequence of amino acids. Proteins, above all, are the main molecules that put the cell's genetic information into action.  

Thus, polynucleotides specify the amino acid sequence of proteins. Proteins, in turn, catalyze many chemical reactions, including those by which new DNA molecules are synthesized. **From the most fundamental point of view, a living cell is a self-replicating collection of catalysts that takes in food, processes this food to derive both the building blocks and energy needed to make more catalysts, and discards the materials left over as waste.** A feedback loop that connects proteins and polynucleotides forms the basis for this autocatalytic, self-reproducing behavior of living organisms.


### All cells translate RNA into protein the same way  

The translation of genetic information from the 4-letter alphabet of polynucleotides into the 20-letter alphabet of proteins is a complex process. The information in the sequence of a messenger RNA molecule is read out in groups of three nucleotides at a time: each triplet of nucleotides, or _codon_, specifies a single amino acid in a corresponding protein. Since the number of dintinct triplets that can be foremd from four nucleotides is 4^3, there are 64 possible codons, all of which occur in nature. However, there are only 20 naturally occurring amino acids. That means thhere are necessarily many cases in which several codons correspond to the same amino acid. This genetic code is read out by a special class of small RNA molecules, the _transfer RNAs_ (tRNAs). Each type of tRNA becomes attached at one end to a specific amino acid, and displays at its other end a specific sequence of three nucleotides - an anticodon - that enables it to recognize, through base-pairing, a particular codon or subset of codons in mRNA. The intricate chemcistry that enables these tRNAs to translate a specific sequcne of A, C, G, and U nucleotides in an mRNA molecule into a specific sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule occurs on the ribosome, a large multimolecular machine composed of both protein and ribosomal RNA.

(B) Polynucletides (the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, which are nucletide polymers) provide the sequence information, while proteins (amino acid polymers) provide most of the catalytic functions that serve - through a complex set of chemical reactions - to bring about the synthesis of more polynucleotides and proteins of the same types.  


### Each protein is encoded by a specific gene  

DNA molecules as a rule are very large, containing the specifications for thousands of proteins. Special sequences in the DNA serve as punctuation, defining where the information for each protein begins and ends. And individual segments of the long DNA sequence are transcribed into separate mRNA molecules, coding for different proteins. Each such DNA segment represents one gene. A complication is that RNA molecules transcribed from the same DNA segment can often be processed in more than one way, so as to give rise to a set of alternative versions of a protein, especially in more complex cells such as those of plants and animals. In addition, some DNA segments - a smaller number - are transcribed into RNA molecules that are not translated but have catalytic, regulatory, or structural functions; such DNA segments also count as genes. A gene therefore is defined as the segment of DNA sequence corresponding to a single protein or set of alternative protein variants or to a single catalytic, regulatory, or structural RNA molecule.

In all cells, the expression of individual genes is regulated: instead of manufacturing its full repertoire of possible proteins at full tilt all the time, the cell adjusts the rate of transcription and translation of different genes independently, according to need. Stretches of regulatory DNA are interspersed among the segments that code for protein, and these noncoding regions bind to special protein molecules that control the local rate of transcription. The quantity and organization of the regulatory DNA vary widely from one class of organisms to another, but the basic strategy is universal. In this way, **the genome of the cell - that is, the totality of its genetic information as embodied in its complete DNA sequence** - dictates not only the nature of the cell's proteins, but also when and where they are to be made.
